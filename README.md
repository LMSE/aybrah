Analyzing Yeasts by Reconstructing Ancestry of Homologs (AYbRAH)

AYbRAH is available as orthoXML, tsv, and JSON formats.

Webpages for homolog groups can be viewed at https://kcorreia.github.io/aybrah/

Available raw data for each homolog group: unaligned sequence files, MAFFT aligned sequence files, upto 100 PhyML bootstrap trees, Gblocks html output, mitochondrial localization predictions, Phobius predictions, or ETE3-constructed trees. Please send a message if you are interested in a compressed file of any or all data.
